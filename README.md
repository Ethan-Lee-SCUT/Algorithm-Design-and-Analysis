1. What is the difference between a hardwired implementation and a microprogrammed
   implementation of a control unit?

   **Solution** : The principal advantage of the use of microprogramming to implement a control unit is that it simplifies the design of the control unit. Thus, it is both cheaper and less error prone to implement. A hardwired control unit must contain complex logic for sequencing through the many micro-operations of the instruction cycle. On the other hand, the decoders and sequencing logic unit of a microprogrammed control unit are very simple pieces of logic.

2. What is the purpose of a control memory?

   **Solution** :  The control memory contains a problem that discribe the behaviors of the contro unit.
